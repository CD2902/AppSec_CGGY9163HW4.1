The intents demonstrated in the assignment, SecondFragment.kt and ThirdFragment.kt, the proper way we should do the intent is the explicit intent within the ThirdFrament.kt
We want to use explicit intent on the SecondFragment.kt to specify calling to scrollingprofileactivty instead of calling intent.actionall because it gives access to users to activiate all the activity in the project and it seems not doing so will activate the activity that opens the browser that displays the Json response of the GiftCard Server which that not what we want since its a mobile apps that render the jpg products.
